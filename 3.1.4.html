    <p>Here I've made the paragraphs 50 pixels high and turned their borders on so you can see what fifty pixels looks like.</p>
	<p>The top margin of each paragraph is 50 pixels and the bottom margin is 30 pixels, so you might expect 80 pixels of space between them.</p>
	<p>As you can see, the margin is equal to the paragraph height&#8212;50 pixels; the margins have collapsed and only the larger of the two touching margins has effect.</p>
