        <h2>Margin Demo</h2>
        <p>No styles are applied to either of these paragraphs.</p>
        <p>However,there is clearly space between them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='withBorder'>
        <h2>Margin Demo-with borders turned on</h2>
        <p>This is the same arrangement of a heading and two paragraphs but now the borders are visible, and you can see how the default margins create space between the elements.</p>
        <p>Margins push an element away from elements it would otherwise touch.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class='withoutMargin'>
        <h2>Margin Demoâ€”borders on, but without margins</h2>
        <p>Here the margins are set to 0 (zero), so the elements' borders now touch.</p>
        <p>Be aware that almost every element has margins by default, and you will often want to eliminate or adjust the default margin settings to get the effect you want.</p>
